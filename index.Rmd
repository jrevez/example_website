title: "R Markdown Website"
---

This is the home page of a simple R Markdown Website. In this example we have two pages:

  - **Home page:** The first page of the website. When you create your own website, you can make this an introductory page of what your project is, for example. 
  - **How to build your own website:** This page includes:
      - Information on what software and files are required to build an R Markdown website
      - Information on how to configure your website
      - Step-by-step instructions to build and publish your website
      - Links to useful online resources to enhance your website
  
You can navigate between the pages using the navigation bar at the top of the website.
